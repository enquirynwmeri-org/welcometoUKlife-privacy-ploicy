Last Updated: February 17, 2026

Welcome to Welcome to UK Life. We are committed to protecting your privacy while helping you navigate your new life in the United Kingdom. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

1. OUR PRIVACY PHILOSOPHY: "LOCAL FIRST"
Unlike many modern apps, Welcome to UK Life is built on a "Privacy-by-Design" architecture.

No Cloud Storage: We do not host your personal files, documents, or address book on our servers.

No AI Processing: We do not use Artificial Intelligence to scan, read, or process your personal notes or documents.

Total Control: All personal data you enter into the app stays on your device.

2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT (AND DON'T COLLECT)
A. Personal Data You Provide (Stored Locally)
You may choose to store the following information within the app:

Address Book: Contact details for UK-specific services or personal contacts.

Checklists & Reminders: Personal task tracking and alert schedules.

Document Shelf: Digital copies of IDs, permits, or agreements.

Communication Logs: Private notes regarding your interactions.

Note: This data is stored in the app's local database on your smartphone. We cannot see, access, or recover this information if you lose your device.

B. Automatically Collected Information (Third-Party)
To keep the app free, we use Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain data, including:

Device Identifiers: Such as the Google Advertising ID (AAID) or Apple ID for Advertisers (IDFA).

Usage Data: Information about how you interact with ads.

Approximate Location: Derived from your IP address to show locally relevant UK ads.

For more information, please visit How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services.

3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use the information stored on your device to:

Provide offline access to your documents and logs.

Trigger local notifications for your set reminders.

Facilitate one-click sharing of documents via your preferred messaging apps.

4. DATA SHARING
We do not sell your personal data.

User-Initiated Sharing: When you use the "One-Click Sharing" feature, you are choosing to send your data through a third-party app (like WhatsApp or Email). Please review the privacy policies of those specific apps.

Ad Technology Providers: AdMob may share limited device data with its authorized ad technology providers to deliver and measure ads.

5. YOUR RIGHTS (UK GDPR)
Since your data is stored locally, you have the ultimate "Right to Erasure":

Deletion: You can delete any specific log, contact, or document at any time within the app.

Complete Removal: Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all locally stored data.

Access: You can view all data you have entered directly within the app interface.

6. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS
Independent Service: Welcome to UK Life is an independent productivity tool. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or an official representative of the UK Government, the NHS, or the Home Office.

Official Information: For official guidance, always consult www.gov.uk.

7. SECURITY
We rely on your device's native security features (Passcode, FaceID, Fingerprint) to protect the data stored within the app. We recommend using a secure screen lock on your device.
